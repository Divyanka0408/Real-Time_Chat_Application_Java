# Real-Time_Chat_Application_Java
The Real-Time Chat Application in Java focuses on creating an interactive platform that allows multiple users to communicate instantly over a network. Using socket programming, the project establishes a reliable connection between a central server and multiple clients, enabling real-time data exchange. The system also integrates a Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed with Java Swing, providing users with an intuitive and user-friendly chat environment.

By combining networking principles, multi-threading, and GUI components, this project demonstrates how Java can be used to implement scalable and efficient communication systems capable of handling concurrent users with minimal latency.

Through this project, I explored core programming concepts like socket communication, input/output streams, event handling, and synchronization — all of which are essential for developing distributed applications in modern computing
